[{"content":"紀念一下，終於在颱風假的這幾天架設自己的網站（拋棄mxdium, wxxdpress的第一步），第一篇文章簡單記錄一下完成步驟來試試發佈文章！\n架站步驟 這次使用的是 Hugo 生成網站模板，可以到 官方網站 挑選自己喜歡的主題，不過前幾次下載專案跑的時候一直沒成功，有幾次是遇到專案的某些 library deprecated ==，推測可能有些作者已經沒再維護了。\n安裝需要的工具 brew install npm\rbrew install hugo\r指令小抄 建立一個新的專案，這裏我挑的是 Doks Theme 。\nnpm create thulite@latest -- --template doks\rinstall dependencies\nnpm install\r試著在 local 端啟動看看，順利的話要可以看得到跑起來的主題\nnpm run dev\r本地端可以看到主題頁面之後，下一步就是使用 Github Actions deploy 到 Github了。參考 Thulite 官方文件教學，在專案檔路徑之下建立一個新檔案 .github/workflows/deploy.yml，並把官方文件提供的範例 YAML 檔貼上。（照貼就可以，line 7 branches 名稱要記得跟自己使用的 branch 相同）\n到自己的 Github 建立新的專案，專案檔名可以隨意取名。建立 repo 之後到 Github Settings \u0026gt; Pages \u0026gt; 選擇 Github Actions 作為 deploy source。\n回到 code, Production folder \u0026gt; hugo.toml 裡面， baseurl 貼上自已 github page 的網址，例如 \u0026ldquo;https://yxuan0329.github.io/xuansite/\u0026rdquo; 。\n最後推上 github 就大功告成。等 deploy 完成之後就可以到自己的網址瀏覽網頁了 耶 🥳\n","date":"2024-10-04","id":0,"permalink":"/xuansite/blog/start-from-hugo/","summary":"HUGO初學習！終於架自己的網站🤓","tags":[],"title":"Start From Hugo"},{"content":"Well-thought-through product announcements will help increase feature awareness and engage users with new functionality.
